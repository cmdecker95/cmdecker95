**Full-Stack Developer | Data Scientist**

Avid problem solver with a passion for the practical. Self-taught programmer with experience in full-stack development and data science.

Building solutions is all about picking the right tools. For that reason, I don‚Äôt champion any one framework, library, or language. Rather, I hand roll the right stack for the job, which has motivated me to build experience with (and have opinions on) a wide array of tools.

If I had to pick one tech stack for life, though, it would be Astro or SvelteKit for the app framework, TypeScript and Zod for type-safety, Prisma and Postgres for databasing, and Railway or Vercel for deployment. Keep it minimal, keep it practical.

Thanks for checking out my profile. Feel free to browse my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or project ideas!
