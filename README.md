# Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian, and I'm a **self-taught programmer**.

> To be fair, I took some college classes here and there, but I credit my proficiency to Udemy, YouTube, and Codecademy.

## Skills
- **Full-stack web development.** Astro, SvelteKit, React, Vite.
- **Data engineering.** Python, Kafka, SQL, Prisma.
- **Other useful stuff.** Docker, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bash, Vim, Linux.

## Current Work
- **Booz Allen Hamilton.** I'm the Technical Product Owner on a team of data engineers, BI analysyts, and front-end developers. We manage and deliver multiple software and data products to clients for a variety of use cases.
- **Web dev for fun.** On the side, I make static marketing sites and full-featured web apps for my friends and family. I'm most proud of an eCommerce site for the Texas A&M VERO Program.
- **Always be learning.** In my free time, I'm always studying something new. I just passed the **GitHub Foundations Certification Exam**, and now I'm learning **Apache Kafka** for my next position.
